For my documentary on bulletin board systems, I interviewed John Sheetz,
KA2GI, who was involved in RTTY art for an extended amount of time. As I
finished that production, I went to give a copy to Mr. Sheetz, and found
out to my sadness that he had become a "silent key" and passed away in
January of 2005. I had already found out about the loss of Don Royer, a
giant in this sub-culture of collecting and creating RTTY art. I wrote
about this situation, and was contacted by a number of RTTY folks, including
Marvin Collins, who told me about Doug Nelson, who had a collection of
over 1,700 RTTY artworks from the various nights of trading over the decades.
I contacted Mr. Nelson and he sent along this collection, which he
estimates to be something on the order of half of all the artwork he had
seen over the years. 
<P>
To all these people and many more, this collection is dedicated to them.
